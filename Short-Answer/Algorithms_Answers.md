#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
while a < n^3:
1.
a = 0 
2.
a = n^2
3.
a = 2n^2
4.
a = 2n^2 + n^2 = 3N^2
5.
4n^2
...
Will loop through N number of times 

Answer:
O(n)

b)
First loop runs N times so that one is O(n)
Second loop:
1. j = 1
2. j = 4
3. j = 8 
...
Second loop will run ~log(n) number of times 
log(N) 
...
The two loops together: O(n) * O(log(n))

Answer:
O(n(log(n))

c) O(n)
